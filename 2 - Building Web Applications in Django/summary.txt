Module 1 - Data Models
    This section explores how we define models in Django and then we build the data models and explore the administration interface for our application. Data models are how Django interacts with the underlying database to store and retrieve data.

    - Understanding Model View Controller (MVC) (Model - data, View - looks, Controller - code behind)
    - Django Data Models
        Implements an Object Relational Mapper*
        Benefits
            Able to write only Python code (i.e. no explicit SQL)
            Gain database portability (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL...)
            Migrations both creat and evolve our databse schema
            A sweet administrator interface
            Automatic form generation and validation (later)
    - Django Migrations
        python3 manage.py makemigrations (comando para ler o models.py e criar / evoluir os arquivos migrations)
        python3 manage.py migrate (comando para ler os arquivos migrations e criar / evoluir as tabelas no banco de dados)

Module 2 - Django Views
    Views are the aspect of Django applications that produce the web pages that are shown to our users. Views are one of several core elements of Django applications.

    - URL Routing in Django
    - Django Views (from django.views import View)
    - Inside Django Views and HTML Escaping in Django
    - Using Templates in Django (Template Render Process, Render Data + Template -- Render Engine --> Rendered Output)* (from django.shortcuts import render)
    - The Django Template Language (DTL) (Substitution, Calling Code, Logic, Blocks)
    - Inheritance in Django Templates (Template Inheritance Process, Render Data + Base Template + Template -- Render Engine --> Rendered Output)
    - Reversing Django Views and URLs (from django.urls import reverse, reverse_lazy)

Module 3 - Django Generic Views
    We review Python Object Orientation and look at the generic views capability within Django. We use generic views by extending Django classes to make a new view class.
    
    - Python Objects (Part 1 to 4)
    - Django Generic Views
        Generic views allow us to produce lots of similar pages without cutting, pasting and editing boiler plate
        Quicker development
        Consistent User Experience
        Less lines of code means fewer mistakes

Module 4 - Forms in HTTP and HTML
    We cover how GET and POST work, how forms are constructed from HTML, how we protect our applications against Cross-Site Scripting Forgery (CSRF), and how we handle browser refreshes after POST.

    - Forms, GET, POST, and HTTP (POST to create and modify and GET to read and search)
    - Building HTML Forms (HTML Input types: Text, Password, Radio Button, Check Box, Select / Drop Down, Text area, submit, button, color, date, email, number, url)
    - Forms and Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    - CSRF Support in Django (DTL: {% csrf_token %})
    - The POST Refresh Pattern (sending same post again after hitting refresh button)
    - Implementing POST Redirect in Django (POST-REDIRECT-GET-Refresh)

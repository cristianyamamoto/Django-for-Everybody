Module 3 - Hypertext Markup Language (from WA4E Specialization)
    We briefly cover the basics of the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) that is the markup for web pages. For some students this material will be relatively easy and mostly review.

Module 5 - Introducing Structured Query Language (SQL)
    This is a quick look at databases in general and the basic operations (CRUD) in Structured Query Language (SQL). We don't go too far into SQL because we will be using Django's model capabilities to build the databases for our application. The primary goal is to examine how Django uses SQL.
